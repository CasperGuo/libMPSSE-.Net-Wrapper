libMPSSE-.Net-Wrapper
=====================

A C# wrapper to the FTDI devices library libMPSSE

This version has added basic I2C support. 

This also includes a c# port of the Arduino LCD driving Library from here https://bitbucket.org/fmalpartida/new-liquidcrystal/wiki/Home. Only the I2C bits have been ported. 

But now you can drive a simple I2C based LCD from .NET over the F232H (and family)!

I tested on this device https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-ft232h-breakout/overview.

I tested with this lcd (YwRobot Arduino LCM1602 IIC V1) https://arduino-info.wikispaces.com/LCD-Blue-I2C.
